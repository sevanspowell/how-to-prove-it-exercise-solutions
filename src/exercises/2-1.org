- Let j stand for Jane.
- Let r stand for Roger.
- ∃x(P(x) ∧ S(j,x)) ∧ ∃y(P(y) ∧ S(r,y))

*** 1e
- ∃x(P(x) ∧ S(j,x) ∧ S(r,x)), where letters have same meaning as above.

** Exercise 2
*** 2a
- Let C(x) stand for "x bought a Rolls Royce with cash."
- Let R(x) stand for "x is rich."
- Let U(y,x) stand for "y is an uncle of x."
- ∀x(x bought Rolls Royce with cash → x has a rich uncle)
- ∀x(C(x) → ∃y(U(y,x) ∧ R(y)))

*** 2b
- Let D(x) stand for "x is in the dorm."
- Let M(x) stand for "x has the measles."
- Let F(y,x) stand for "y is a friend of x."
- Let Q(x) stand for "x will have to be quarantined."
- ∃x[(D(x) ∧ M(x)) → ∀y(∃z(F(y,z) ∧ D(z)) → Q(y))]

*** 2c
- Let F(x) stand for "x failed the test."
- Let T(x,y) stand for "x will tutor y."
- Let A(x) stand for "x got an A."
- Let D(x) stand for "x got a D."
- (nobody failed the test) → (everyone who got an A will tutor everyone who got a D)
- (¬∃xF(x)) → ∀y(A(y) → ∃z(D(z) ∧ T(y,z)))

*** 2d
- Let D(x) stand for "x can do it."
- Let j stand for "Jones."
- (there exists a person who can do it) → (Jones can do it)
- ∃xD(x) → D(j)

*** 2d
- (Jones can do it) → (everyone can do it)
- D(j) → ∀xD(x)

** Exercise 3
*** 3a
- ∀a((a > x) → (a > y))
- Free variables: x and y

*** 3b
- ∀a((ax^2 + 4x - 2 = 0)
- ∀a((a ≥ -2) ↔ ∃b(a*(b^2) + 4*b - 2 = 0))
- No free variables.

*** 3c
- ∀x((x^3 - 3x < 3) → (x < 10))
- No free variables.

*** 3d
- (∃x(x^2 + 5x = w) ∧ ∃y(4 - y^2 = w)) → (w > -10 ∧ w < 10)
- Free variable: w.
